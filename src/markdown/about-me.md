Hello there!

I'm Devansh Panirwala (call me Dave) and I am currently doing my bachelors in Computer Science at Purdue Universty. My main concentration is Systems and Security. I made this website to understand how web-development works and I think I am doing a pretty good job for a beginner.

Enough about the website, lets talk about me. I mostly enjoy doing back-end stuff like designing server architecture, scalability, security etc. Right now I would call myself full-stack developer but I have yet to learn a lot of stuff about web development before claiming that accolade. 

What I like about software development is how multiple technologies come together and work towards a common goal to satisfy the requirements of a user. When thinking about it, different people might compare development cycle and architecture to many analogies they have experienced in their life. This abstraction on multiple layers helps bring countless people from all over the world with different ethinicity together to make other people's lives better.

In my spare time, I usually like to converse to people from diverse background about current issues happening around the world and discuss about some new technologies or play games if I am feeling a meditative. Recently I have been teaching myself to cook as I find it very therapeutic when I get overwhelmed with things around me. Strangely enough I cannot stop thinking how similar cooking is to development.

The purpose of this website is to learn about various technologies and showcase the work I have done till now (2 birds with a stone :P). Head over to the [contact section](#contact) and send me text if you wanna go out for a coffee or something (I like it black). If not just send me a good meme I guess.
